Buildings are the building blocks for the basic game loop.
Buildings produce workers that then "power" the rest of the game loop.

Buildings allow worker to perform tasks that they otherwise could not.
Mines allow workers to mine for metals and minerals, farms allow workers to harvest crops etc.
The resources gathered are then used to create more advanced buildings.

There is a soft cap for how many workers a player can have in the world at any given time, this cap is 
reliant on worker housing and on avaliable food. Therefore workers are also a kind of resource that the player
has to manage.
